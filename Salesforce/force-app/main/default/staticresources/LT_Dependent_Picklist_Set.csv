</ul>
<b>Further exemptions can be found under schedule 1A of the QBCC Act and Schedule 1 of the QBCC Regulation</b>","<b>Please note that the class of licence required will depend on the nature of the work provided</b>
<br><br>
(Example; A labour hire company providing a service for Carpentry will only require a Carpentry licence, however if they are providing a variety of different trades that may require a Builder class licence or multiple trade classes).
<br><br>
<b>Scenario 1:</b>
<br><br>
A labour hire company providing unskilled labour who do not perform or supervise building work onsite do not require a QBCC contractor’s licence. However, if the unskilled labour perform or supervise building work, then an appropriate QBCC contractor’s licence may be required by either the labour hire company or the labour hire workers unless an exemption applies under schedule 1A of the QBCC Act.
<br><br>
<b>Scenario 2:</b>
<br><br>
A labour hire company providing carpenters who perform building work onsite to a company which only holds a builder class of contractor’s licence cannot rely upon an exemption within schedule 1A of the QBCC Act. In this scenario either the labour hire company or each labour hire worker would be required to hold a contractor’s licence in an appropriate class to cover the building work performed.
<br><br>
<b>Scenario 3:</b>
<br><br>
A labour hire company providing carpenters who perform building work on site to a company which holds a carpentry class of contractor’s licence can rely upon the subcontractor exemption within schedule 1A, section 2 of the QBCC Act. In this scenario no contractor’s licence would be required by either the labour hire company or the labour hire workers.
<br><br>
Note if the labour hire workers supervise building work and the licensed contractor relies upon this supervision to meet their requirements under Sections 43 and 43A of the QBCC Act to have building work personally and adequately supervised, the labour hire employee would need an appropriate licence authorising the supervision regardless of the licence class held.
